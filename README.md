Intro
=====

The repository contains selected demo programs from [Michael Abrash's "Graphics Programming Black Book"](http://www.jagregory.com/abrash-black-book/), 
originally published in 1997 and released online for free in 2001.

Original source code was written in MASM and/or TASM flavor of assembly, so it's a bit hard 
to compile these days. 

This project has them converted to NASM, with liberal usage of macros, so they may
look quite different from the original, while doing the same (ideally).

The demos were selected arbitrarily, basing on how interesting they looked to me. 
This is why they only start from [Chapter 23](http://www.jagregory.com/abrash-black-book/#chapter-23-bones-and-sinew).

Instructions
============

Demos can be built with a `make`. Makefile is written to use [`nasm`](Demos can be built with a `make`. Makefile is written to use [`nasm`](https://www.nasm.us/) for compilation and [`alink`](http://alink.sourceforge.net/) for linking. 
The easiest way to run them is to use [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/).

Have fun!
